# Odin Project Exercise - Etch-a-Sketch

Hello everyone! This project is an exercise from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), a pretty neat toy to flex our DOM manipulation skills. The purpose is to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. Objective:

    - DOM manipulation: Use JavaScript to create new div elements and append them to an existing container.
    - Event listeners: Add event listeners to the divs to trigger the hover effect and change their background color.
    - User input: Create a button and a popup to get the desired grid size from the user.
    - Grid resizing: Remove the old grid and create a new one based on the user input, ensuring the total area remains constant.
    - Validation: Implement input validation to restrict the grid size between 1 and 100.
    - Color randomization: Use JavaScript's random number generation to assign random RGB values to each square.
    - Color transition: Implement a counter to track the number of iterations and gradually adjust the color values towards black (or another desired      color).
